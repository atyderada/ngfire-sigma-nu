<p fxHide.sm fxHide.xs>The brothers of Sigma Nu are a very close group of men. The men of Sigma Nu take pride in the values of honor, truth, and 
    love that the fraternity holds dear and remains steadfast to the beliefs that tie all of the brothers together. The men of Sigma Nu take great 
    confidence in the fact that each chapter across the nation is consistently loyal to these values, maintaining honor, truth, and love in everyday acts. 
    Sigma Nu strives to achieve a global approach in the understanding of its values. The men of the Beta Upsilon chapter aim to accomplish this goal by 
    taking multiple chapter trips to various locations across the nation, simply to gain a better understanding of what it really means to be a Sigma Nu. 
    In the past two years alone, these men have traveled to Cincinatti, Myrtle Beach, Destin, New Orleans, Nashville, Chicago, and St. Louis, simply to travel 
    the nation and build even greater bonds of friendship and brotherhood. Sigma Nu prides itself on the ability to take men of promise and not only bring out 
    the best in them but to give them the knowledge, values and friendships that will improve their lives in every aspect.
